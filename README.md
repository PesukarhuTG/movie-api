# Search movie API

### Description
It's a study project on [RSSchool Stage0](https://rs.school/js-stage0/) course. Task link [here](https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/blob/master/tasks/js30%23/js30-6.md)<br>
<br>During a week we created an app in private repository, which is getting data from API (I used [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)).<br><br>
The task took about 2-3 days. In [the result](https://pesukarhutg.github.io/movie-api/) you can see the adaptive app, where user can enter a request and get an information about movies: poster, rating, title and description on hover.<br><br>

### Skills
HTML, CSS, JS, work with API
